## 🎁 Free Updates for Your Version

When you buy a plugin, you get all updates for your version of Mautic for free.<br/>
For example, if you buy a plugin for Mautic 5, you get all updates for Mautic 5 at no extra cost.

## ⬆️ Upgrading to a New Mautic Version

If you move to a new major version of Mautic (like from Mautic 5 to Mautic 6), you can get a big discount on the new plugin version.<br/>
Just contact us for your discount code.

## 💡 Why Do We Charge for New Versions?

Each big Mautic update can change how plugins work.<br/>
We rebuild and test plugins for every major Mautic version to make sure everything works well and you get new features.
