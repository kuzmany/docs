## Free Updates for Your Version

When you buy a plugin, you get all updates for your version of Mautic for free.  
For example, if you buy a plugin for Mautic 5, you get all updates for Mautic 5 at no extra cost.

## Upgrading to a New Mautic Version

If you move to a new major version of Mautic (like from Mautic 5 to Mautic 6), you can get a big discount on the new plugin version.  
Just contact us for your discount code.

## Why Do We Charge for New Versions?

Each big Mautic update can change how plugins work.  
We rebuild and test plugins for every major Mautic version to make sure everything works well and you get new features.

## How to Get Your Discount

- Tell us which plugin and which Mautic version you use
- We’ll send you a discount code for your upgrade
