# Upgrades Policy

When you purchase a plugin for a specific version of Mautic, you receive all updates for that version at no extra cost. If you decide to upgrade to a newer version of Mautic, you can buy a new plugin that works with it at a discounted price ([ask for a discount](https://mtcextendee.com/discounts/)). This is our way of thanking you for continuing the journey with us.

## Why Separate Plugins for Different Versions?

Each major version of Mautic is released approximately every two years, for example:

- Mautic 3.0 was released on June 15, 2020
- Mautic 4.0 on May 24, 2021
- Mautic 5.0 on January 9, 2024

Investing in a plugin for one version allows you to use it extensively. We develop new plugins for each version to introduce innovative features and ensure everything works perfectly.

## Upgrade Discounts

- from Mautic 4 to Mautic 5 with a 30% discount
- from Mautic 5 to Mautic 6 with a 50% discount
- from Mautic 6 to Mautic 7 with a 50% discount

Take advantage of these great savings as you upgrade your Mautic version.
