## FAQ

### Can I still personalize my UTM tags?

Sure can! Set them on each channel.

### Automatically add UTM tags during creating new form

This option automatically fills in UTM tag fields when creating a new email, dynamic content, or focus item.

### Which tokens can you support?

You can utilize tokens linked to an entity, such as email ID, name, subject, or category. Additionally, you have the option to use any contact field tokens, similar to how it’s done in the builder.

### What if I’ve already put UTM tags on some links?

No worries. If there’s a tag already, the plugin will leave it be.

### Automatically append UTM parameters to URLs if not exist

This option automatically adds UTM tags if you don’t set them up while creating a new one. This way, you can always be sure that your UTM exists.
