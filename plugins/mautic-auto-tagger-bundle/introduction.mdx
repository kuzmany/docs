## ‚ú® What does this plugin do?

The Mautic Auto Tagger plugin saves you time by adding UTM parameters and custom tags to your links in emails, dynamic content, and focus items. It can even fill in UTM tags for you when you create new emails or content. Use simple tokens to add info like the name of your email or campaign‚Äîno manual work needed!

---

## üåü Main Features

- **Automatic UTM tags:** If your links don‚Äôt have UTM tags, the plugin adds them for you.
- **Pre-filled UTM tags:** Default UTM tags appear automatically when you make a new email, dynamic content, or focus item.
- **Custom tags:** Add your own key-value tags to links.
- **Tokens:** Use tokens to insert info like email name, campaign ID, or contact fields.
- **Transliteration:** Use `|transliterate` to make token values URL-safe.
- **Channel-specific tags:** Choose different tags for Email, Dynamic Content, and Focus.
- **No overwriting:** If a link already has UTM tags, the plugin leaves them alone.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How does it work?

- **Automatic tagging:** When you send an email or use dynamic content, the plugin checks each link. If it doesn‚Äôt have UTM tags, it adds your default UTM tags and any custom tags you set. Tokens in tags are replaced with real values.
- **Pre-filled tags:** When you create a new email, dynamic content, or focus item, the UTM tag fields are filled in for you.
- **Custom tags:** Add as many custom key-value pairs as you want (like `my_param=value` or `tracker={campaignfield=id}`), and use tokens in them.
- **No conflicts:** The plugin won‚Äôt overwrite UTM tags that are already there. Custom tags are only added if their keys aren‚Äôt already used.

## üè∑Ô∏è Using tokens

Tokens let you add info from Mautic automatically to your tags.

- `{contactfield=alias}`: For contact fields (like `{contactfield=firstname}`)
- `{emailfield=property}`: For email properties (like `{emailfield=name}`)
- `{dynamiccontentfield=property}`: For dynamic content properties
- `{focusfield=property}`: For focus item properties
- `{campaignfield=property}`: For campaign properties
- `{eventfield=property}`: For campaign event properties

**Transliteration:**  
Add `|transliterate` to a token to make it URL-safe.  
Example: `{emailfield=name|transliterate}`

## üí° Example

1. **Set up:** In the plugin settings under "Tags for emails", set:
    - `utm_source`: `mautic`
    - `utm_medium`: `email`
    - `utm_campaign`: `{campaignfield=name|transliterate}`
    - `utm_content`: `{emailfield=name|transliterate}`
    - Custom Tag: `channel=email`
2. **Turn on:** Check "Automatically append UTM parameters to URLs if not exist".
3. **Create:** Make an email called "Summer Sale" in a campaign called "Q3 Promotions" with a link like `https://my-shop.com/products`.
4. **Send:** The link will look like:  
   `https://my-shop.com/products?utm_source=mautic&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Q3-Promotions&utm_content=Summer-Sale&channel=email`
