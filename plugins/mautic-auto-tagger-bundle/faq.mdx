Here are some common questions about the Mautic Auto Tagger plugin, answered in simple language.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Can I personalize my UTM tags?">
    Yes!  
    You can set UTM tags for each channel (like Email, Dynamic Content, or Focus). You can also use tokens to add dynamic values, such as the name of your email or campaign.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if my links already have UTM tags?">
    No worries!  
    The plugin will not change or overwrite UTM tags that are already in your links. It only adds tags if they are missing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which tokens can I use?">
    You can use tokens for email, campaign, contact, and more.  
    For example:

    - `{contactfield=firstname}` for a contact's first name
    - `{emailfield=name}` for the email name
    - `{campaignfield=name}` for the campaign name

    See the <a href="./introduction">introduction</a> for a full list and more details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does “Automatically add UTM tags during creating new form” mean?">
    This means the plugin will fill in UTM tag fields for you when you create a new email, dynamic content, or focus item. You don’t have to type them in every time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does “Automatically append UTM parameters to URLs if not exist” mean?">
    This means the plugin checks every link. If a link doesn’t have UTM tags, it will add them for you. This way, all your links have the right tracking tags automatically.
