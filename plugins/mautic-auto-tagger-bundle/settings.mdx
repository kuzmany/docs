## Main options

  If you turn this on, the plugin will fill in default UTM tags when you make a new Email, Dynamic Content, or Focus Item.

  If you turn this on, the plugin will add your UTM tags (and custom tags) to any links that don’t already have UTM tags.

## Tags for each channel

You can set default UTM tags and custom tags for:

- **Emails**
- **Dynamic Content**
- **Focus Items**

Each channel has its own section for UTM and custom tags.
