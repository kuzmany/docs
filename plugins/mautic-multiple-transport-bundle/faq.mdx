## FAQ

**How can I send emails with the contact owner's transport?**  
Assign a transport to the user (owner) in their profile. Then, in the email settings, enable "Use Owner Custom Transport".

**Can I use a different transport other than SMTP?**  
Yes, you can use any transport supported by Mautic, such as SMTP, Amazon SES, Mailjet, Sendgrid, and more.

**How do I test if a transport works?**  
Edit the transport and click the "Test" button. A test email will be sent.

**What happens if no transport is set for an email or user?**  
Mautic will use the default transport from your main configuration.

**Is this plugin compatible with all Mautic versions?**  
Yes, it works with Mautic 4 (SMTP only), and Mautic 5/6 (all transports).

**I changed a transport but itâ€™s not used, what should I do?**  
Clear the Mautic cache. Sometimes changes require a cache clear to take effect.

**Who can manage transports?**  
Only users with the right permissions in Mautic can add, edit, or delete transports.

**Can I assign a transport to multiple emails or users at once?**  
Currently, you need to assign transports one by one.

**What if I get an error when sending?**  
Check your DSN, credentials, and try sending a test email. See the Troubleshooting page for more help.
