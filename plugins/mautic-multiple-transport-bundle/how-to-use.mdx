## How to Use

### Before you start

- Make sure you have at least one transport configured in the "Multiple Transport" section.
- If you change a transport and it doesn't work, try clearing the Mautic cache.

### Assign a Transport to an Email

1. Go to the email edit screen in Mautic.
2. You will see a new "Transport" dropdown.
3. Select the transport you want for this email.
4. Save the email.

### Use Contact Owner's Transport

1. In the email edit screen, enable "Use Owner Custom Transport".
2. The email will use the transport assigned to the contact's owner (user), if set.

### Assign a Transport to a User

1. Go to the user profile edit screen.
2. You will see a "Transport" dropdown.
3. Select the transport for this user.
4. Save the user.

### Add or Edit Transports

1. Go to the "Multiple Transport" section in the Mautic admin menu.
2. Click "New" to add a transport, or edit an existing one.
3. Fill in the details (name, DSN, etc).
4. Save.

### Remove or Reset a Transport

- To remove a transport from an email or user, set the dropdown to blank and save.
- If no transport is set, Mautic will use the default transport.

### Test a Transport

- Use the "Test" button when editing a transport to send a test email and check if it works.

### Troubleshooting

- If a transport is not working, double-check the DSN and credentials.
- If changes are not applied, clear the Mautic cache.
- Make sure you have permission to manage transports.
