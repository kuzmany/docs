## Troubleshooting

**Transport not working?**
- Double-check the DSN and credentials for your transport.
- Try sending a test email from the transport edit screen.

**Changes not applied?**
- Clear the Mautic cache after making changes to transports.

**Permission errors?**
- Make sure your user account has permission to manage transports.

**Emails not sending?**
- If no transport is set for an email or user, Mautic uses the default transport.
- Check the Mautic logs for error messages.

**Still having issues?**
- Contact support at [support@mtcextendee.com](mailto:support@mtcextendee.com)
