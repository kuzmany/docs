description: Use data from Mautic form submissions in your Twig templates.

import { Note } from '@mintlify/components';

You can use data that contacts submit through Mautic forms directly in your emails or landing pages using Twig Templates.

<Note>
  **Important:** This only works if the email is sent using:
  *   A "Send email to contact" action directly on a form.
  *   A "Send email" action in a campaign that starts when a form is submitted.
</Note>

## Form Data Tokens

When an email is sent in one of the ways mentioned above, you can use these special tokens:

*   `{{ formresult }}`: Contains the data from the **single, most recent** form submission by the contact.
*   `{{ formresults }}`: Contains a list (array) of **all** form submissions made by the contact.

## Using the Last Submission (`formresult`)

To show data from the contact's latest form submission, use the `formresult` token. You access the submitted values using the form field's alias (the unique name you gave the field).

```twig
<p>Thanks for submitting, {{ formresult.firstname }}!</p>
<p>Here's what we received:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First Name: {{ formresult.firstname }}</li>
  <li>Email: {{ formresult.email }}</li>
  {# Use the alias of your form field #}
  <li>Your Message: {{ formresult.message_field_alias }}</li>
</ul>
```

## Using All Submissions (`formresults`)

If you need to show data from older submissions, you can loop through the `formresults` list. Each item in the list (`result` in the example below) works like the `formresult` token.

```twig
<p>Your submission history:</p>
<ul>
{% for result in formresults %}
    <li>
        Submitted on {{ result.dateSubmitted|date('Y-m-d H:i') }}:
        Name: {{ result.firstname }} {{ result.lastname }}
        {# Add other fields if needed #}
    </li>
{% else %}
    <li>You haven't submitted this form before.</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
```

This lets you show past interactions or use historical form data in your content.
