title: Twig Templates Forms Support
description: Use Mautic form submission data directly within your Twig templates.
---
import { Note } from '@mintlify/components';

The Twig Templates plugin allows you to access data submitted through Mautic forms directly within your email or landing page content.

<Note>
  This feature is only available when an email is sent using either:
  *   The **"Send email to contact"** form action.
  *   A **"Send email"** campaign action where the campaign source is a form submission.
</Note>

## Available Form Tokens

When the conditions above are met, you can use these special tokens:

*   `{{ formresult }}`: An object containing the data from the **most recent** form submission by the contact.
*   `{{ formresults }}`: An array containing **all** form submission data associated with the contact.

## Using the Last Form Result

Access fields from the most recent submission using the `formresult` object. The field names correspond to the form field aliases.

```twig
<p>Thank you for your submission, {{ formresult.firstname }}!</p>
<p>We have received your details:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First Name: {{ formresult.firstname }}</li>
  <li>Last Name: {{ formresult.lastname }}</li>
  <li>Email: {{ formresult.email }}</li>
  {# Access other form fields using their alias #}
  <li>Your Message: {{ formresult.message_field_alias }}</li>
</ul>
```

## Using All Form Results

If you need to access data from multiple submissions by the same contact, you can loop through the `formresults` array. Each item in the array is an object similar to `formresult`.

```twig
<p>Here is a history of your submissions:</p>
<ul>
{% for result in formresults %}
    <li>
        Submission on {{ result.dateSubmitted|date('Y-m-d H:i') }}:
        First Name: {{ result.firstname }}, Last Name: {{ result.lastname }}
        {# Add other relevant fields #}
    </li>
{% else %}
    <li>No previous submissions found.</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
```

This allows you to display historical data or perform logic based on past interactions through forms.
