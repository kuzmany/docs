import { Note } from '@mintlify/components';

The Twig Templates plugin provides several objects and tokens you can use to access Mautic data and perform actions within your templates.

## Contact Object (`contact`)

The `contact` object provides access to the fields of the contact viewing the email or landing page.

*   **Standard Fields:** Access any standard Mautic contact field using its alias (e.g., `contact.firstname`, `contact.email`, `contact.city`).
    ```twig
    Hello {{ contact.firstname|default('there') }}!
    Your email is {{ contact.email }}.
    ```
*   **Custom Fields:** Access custom contact fields using their alias (e.g., `contact.custom_field_alias`).
    ```twig
    Your preference: {{ contact.preference_field }}
    ```
*   **Tags:** Access the contact's tags as an array.
    ```twig
    {% if 'VIP' in contact.tags %}
      <p>Welcome, VIP!</p>
    {% endif %}

    <ul>
    {% for tag in contact.tags %}
        <li>{{ tag }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    ```
*   **Segments:** Access the segments (lists) the contact belongs to as an array of objects. Each object has properties like `id` and `name`.
    ```twig
    {% for segment in contact.segments %}
        {% if segment.name == 'Newsletter Subscribers' %}
            <p>Thanks for subscribing!</p>
        {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    ```
*   **Companies (`contact.companies`):** Access *all* companies associated with the contact as an array of company objects. Each object contains the company's fields.
    ```twig
    {% if contact.companies is not empty %}
        <p>Associated Companies:</p>
        <ul>
            {% for company in contact.companies %}
                <li>
                    {{ company.companyname }}
                    {% if company.is_primary == '1' %} (Primary){% endif %}
                    - {{ company.companycity|default('City Unknown') }}
                </li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    {% else %}
        <p>No companies associated with this contact.</p>
    {% endif %}
    ```
*   **Primary Company Shortcut (`contact.primaryCompany`):** Returns the primary company object if one is set. If no company is explicitly marked as primary, it returns the *first* company associated with the contact. Returns `null` if the contact has no associated companies.
    ```twig
    {% if contact.primaryCompany %}
        <p>Primary/First Company Name: {{ contact.primaryCompany.companyname }}</p>
        <p>Industry: {{ contact.primaryCompany.companyindustry|default('Not specified') }}</p>
    {% else %}
        <p>No company associated.</p>
    {% endif %}
    ```

## Form Result Tokens

These tokens are available only when an email is triggered by a form submission action (either directly or via a campaign). See [Forms Support](/twig-templates/forms-support) for details.

*   **`formresult`**: An object containing the data from the *most recent* form submission by the contact. Field names correspond to form field aliases.
    ```twig
    Thank you for submitting the form, {{ formresult.firstname }}!
    Your message: {{ formresult.message_field }}
    ```
*   **`formresults`**: An array containing *all* form submission data associated with the contact. Each element is an object like `formresult`.
    ```twig
    <p>Submission History:</p>
    <ul>
    {% for result in formresults %}
        <li>{{ result.dateSubmitted|date('Y-m-d') }}: {{ result.email }}</li>
    {% else %}
        <li>No submissions recorded.</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    ```

## Email Tokens (`tokens`)

When sending emails via the API, you can pass custom tokens in the payload. These are accessible via the `tokens` object. See the [API Documentation](/twig-templates/api) for usage.

```twig
{# Assuming 'mycustomtoken' was passed in the API payload #}
Your special code is: {{ tokens['{mycustomtoken}'] }}
```

<Note>
  This list covers tokens specifically added or enhanced by the Twig Templates plugin. Standard Twig variables and functions (like `now` for the current time) are also available. Refer to the official [Twig Documentation](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/) for more on standard Twig capabilities.
