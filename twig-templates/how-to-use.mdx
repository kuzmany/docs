Learn how to leverage Twig templates for customizing your Mautic experience. Twig provides a powerful yet simple syntax for adding logic directly into your Mautic assets.

## Basic Example: Personalized Greeting

Here's a fundamental example showing how to greet a contact by their first name, with a fallback if the name isn't available:

```twig
{# Check if the contact's firstname field has a value #}
{% if contact.firstname %}
  <p>Hello {{ contact.firstname }}!</p>
{% else %}
  <p>Hello there!</p>
{% endif %}

{# A more concise way using the 'default' filter #}
<p>Welcome, {{ contact.firstname|default('Valued Customer') }}!</p>
```

This example demonstrates:
1.  Using an `if/else` block to check if `contact.firstname` exists.
2.  Using the `default` filter as a shorthand to provide a fallback value directly within the output `{{ }}` tags.

## Learning Twig

The Twig syntax is designed to be easy to learn. You don't need to stress over complex syntax.
