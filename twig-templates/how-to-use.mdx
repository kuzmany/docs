Learn how to leverage Twig templates for customizing your Mautic experience. Twig provides a powerful yet simple syntax for adding logic directly into your Mautic assets.

## Basic Example: Personalized Greeting

Here's a fundamental example showing how to greet a contact by their first name, with a fallback if the name isn't available:

```twig
{# Check if the contact's firstname field has a value #}
{% if contact.firstname %}
  <p>Hello {{ contact.firstname }}!</p>
{% else %}
  <p>Hello there!</p>
{% endif %}

{# A more concise way using the 'default' filter #}
<p>Welcome, {{ contact.firstname|default('Valued Customer') }}!</p>
```

This example demonstrates:
1.  Using an `if/else` block to check if `contact.firstname` exists.
2.  Using the `default` filter as a shorthand to provide a fallback value directly within the output `{{ }}` tags.

## Learning Twig

The Twig syntax is designed to be easy to learn. You don't need to stress over complex syntax.

## Embedding Templates

You can embed one Twig Template within another using a special token format. This allows you to create reusable components or complex conditional logic structures, keeping your main email or landing page templates cleaner.

Use the `{twigtemplate=TEMPLATE_NAME}` token, replacing `TEMPLATE_NAME` with the exact name of the Twig Template you created in Mautic.

**Example: Tier-Based Promotional Offers**

Imagine you want to show different offers to contacts based on their membership level, stored in a custom field called `membership_tier`. You could create separate Twig Templates for each offer (e.g., `Gold Member Offer`, `Silver Member Offer`, `Standard Welcome Offer`).

Then, in your main email or landing page template, you can use conditional logic to embed the correct offer based on the contact's `membership_tier` field:

```twig
<h2>Your Special Offer</h2>

{% if contact.membership_tier == 'gold' %}
  {twigtemplate=Gold Member Offer}
{% elseif contact.membership_tier == 'silver' %}
  {twigtemplate=Silver Member Offer}
{% else %}
  {# Default offer for standard members or if tier is not set #}
  {twigtemplate=Standard Welcome Offer}
{% endif %}

<p>Thank you for being a customer!</p>
```

This approach makes your main template much tidier and easier to manage. If you need to update an offer, you only edit the specific offer template (e.g., `Gold Member Offer`), and the change automatically applies wherever it's embedded. Just ensure the template names you reference exactly match those saved in your Mautic Twig Templates list.
