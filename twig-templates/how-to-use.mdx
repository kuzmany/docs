# Using Twig Templates

Learn how to leverage Twig templates for customizing your Mautic experience. Twig provides a powerful yet simple syntax for adding logic directly into your Mautic assets.

## Basic Example

Here's a simple example showing how to display different content based on a contact's custom field value (e.g., `affinity`):

```twig
{% if contact.affinity == 'private' %}
  <p>This is Private Content</p>
{% elseif contact.affinity == 'b2b' %}
  <p>This is B2B Content</p>
{% elseif contact.affinity == 'agency' %}
  <p>This is Agency Content</p>
{% else %}
  <p>This is Default Content</p>
{% endif %}
```

This example demonstrates conditional logic based on the `affinity` field of the `contact` object.

## Learning Twig

The Twig syntax is designed to be easy to learn. You don't need to stress over complex syntax.
