Here's how to add the Twig Templates plugin to your Mautic:

1.  **Download:** After buying, click the download link in your email to get the plugin file (it will be a folder).
2.  **Upload:** Put the downloaded plugin folder into the `plugins/` folder inside your main Mautic files. Make sure the folder is named clearly, for example, `MauticTwigTemplatesBundle`.
3.  **Clear Cache:** Open your server's command line (terminal), go to your main Mautic folder, and run this command:
    ```bash
    php bin/console cache:clear
    ```
    This helps Mautic refresh things.
4.  **Update Plugins:** Run this command so Mautic knows about the new plugin:
    ```bash
    php bin/console mautic:plugins:reload
    ```
5.  **Update Files:** Lastly, run this command to update necessary files:
    ```bash
    php bin/console mautic:assets:generate
    ```

That's it! The plugin should now be ready to use in Mautic.
