Beyond using Twig Templates within Mautic emails and landing pages, you can also embed their rendered output directly onto your external websites or access them through a unique URL. This allows you to leverage Mautic's personalization capabilities in other parts of your web presence.

When you view a saved Twig Template in Mautic, you'll find options to "Embed Twig Template", providing you with the necessary code or links.

## Javascript for Websites

This method provides a Javascript snippet that you can place on any external webpage. When the page loads, this script will fetch and display the rendered output of your Twig Template. This is ideal for dynamically inserting personalized content blocks, banners, or messages onto your website, blog, or other web properties.

**How to Use:**

1.  Navigate to the Twig Template you want to embed within Mautic.
2.  Find the "Embed Twig Template" option (often via a button or modal).
3.  Copy the provided Javascript code snippet.
4.  Paste this snippet into the HTML source code of your external webpage where you want the template's output to appear.

**Example Snippet:**

```html
<!-- Example Javascript embed code for a Twig Template -->
<script async defer type="text/javascript"
src="https://your-mautic.com/twig/template/{TEMPLATE_ID}/{UNIQUE_HASH}.js"></script>
```

<Note>
  Replace `https://your-mautic.com` with your actual Mautic instance URL. The `{TEMPLATE_ID}` and `{UNIQUE_HASH}` will be specific to the template you are embedding, as provided by Mautic.
</Note>

The content will be rendered based on the contact identified by the Mautic tracking cookie present in the visitor's browser. If the visitor is unknown, default values or fallback logic within your Twig template will be used.

## Direct HTML Link

Mautic also provides a direct URL that renders the Twig Template as a standalone HTML page. This link can be useful for:

*   **Previewing:** Quickly checking the output of a template.
*   **Iframes:** Embedding the template output within an `<iframe>` on an external site.
*   **Direct Sharing:** Sharing a specific, potentially personalized, piece of content directly.

**How to Use:**

1.  Navigate to the Twig Template in Mautic.
2.  Find the "Embed Twig Template" option.
3.  Copy the "Direct HTML link".

**Example Link:**

```
https://your-mautic.com/twig/template/{TEMPLATE_ID}/{UNIQUE_HASH}.html
```

<Note>
  Again, replace placeholders with your Mautic URL and the specific ID/hash provided for the template. Accessing this URL will render the template based on the accessing browser's Mautic tracking cookie, if available.
</Note>

Using these embedding options allows you to extend Mautic's personalization power beyond its core channels.
